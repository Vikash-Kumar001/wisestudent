      insight: "That's frustration mixed with fatigue. Recognizing this helps you pause before reacting.",
      reflection: "Recognizing you feel 'Frustrated and Overwhelmed' helps you pause before reacting. Naming this emotion allows you to respond thoughtfully rather than escalating the situation. When you label your feeling, you can choose a calm response strategy that maintains classroom management while addressing the students' needs.",
      teacherTip: "Pause and label your feelings before reacting to stressful moments. When you name your frustration, you create space to choose your response. You might say to yourself: 'I'm feeling frustrated. Let me take a breath and use a calm redirect strategy.'"

      insight: "That's defensiveness mixed with embarrassment. Acknowledging this helps you process the feedback more constructively.",
      reflection: "Acknowledging you feel 'Defensive and Embarrassed' helps you process the feedback more constructively. You can say to yourself: 'I'm feeling defensive right now. Let me take a moment to breathe and consider what I can learn from this feedback.' This allows you to respond professionally rather than reactively.",
      teacherTip: "Naming your defensive feelings helps you receive feedback with openness. When you label your embarrassment, you can choose to see feedback as growth opportunities rather than personal attacks. This models resilience for your students."

      reflection: "Recognizing you feel 'Proud and Joyful' helps you savor this meaningful teaching moment. You can say: 'I'm feeling so proud of this student's progress and joyful about this breakthrough.' This reinforces positive classroom culture and teaches students to appreciate their achievements.",
      teacherTip: "Naming positive emotions like 'pride' and 'joy' helps you celebrate student successes authentically. When you express these emotions, students learn to recognize and express their own achievements, strengthening classroom community."

      correct: 3, // Uncomfortable and Drained
      insight: "That's discomfort mixed with emotional fatigue. Naming this helps you set healthy boundaries.",
      reflection: "Identifying you feel 'Uncomfortable and Drained' helps you set healthy boundaries. You can say to yourself: 'I'm feeling drained by this negative conversation. I need to protect my energy.' This allows you to choose how to engage or disengage in a way that preserves your wellbeing.",
      teacherTip: "Naming your discomfort helps you protect your emotional energy. When you recognize you're feeling drained, you can choose to step away or redirect conversations toward more constructive topics. This models self-care and boundary-setting for your students."

      correct: 1, // Tired and Frustrated
      insight: "That's fatigue mixed with frustration. Acknowledging this helps you adjust your approach.",
      reflection: "Acknowledging you feel 'Tired and Frustrated' helps you adjust your teaching approach. You can say to yourself: 'I'm feeling tired and frustrated. Let me adapt my lesson to match the class energy rather than fighting it.' This allows you to be flexible and responsive to the classroom dynamic.",
      teacherTip: "Naming your fatigue helps you adapt rather than push through. When you recognize you're tired, you can adjust your teaching strategy to match the moment. This shows students that flexibility and self-awareness are valuable skills."
